### Playing Nim Game with Reinforcement Learning
`nim_learning.ipynb` Introduce the concept of Q Learning, a starting lesson in Reinforcement Learning (RL), and the math behind it. We'll code *Nim*, a popular simple strategy game. Learn how to build a simple yet powerful (computer) expert Nim player, then we'll train a *Q-learner* player from scratch with RL to play against it. Is RL powerful enough to beat the expert?
